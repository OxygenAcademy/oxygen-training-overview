During the course, students build serveral applications that form part of a platform for managing a hotel. 

The applications are the following:

- A dashboard for managing the hotel that consists of:
    + A **React JS** front-end, built with React, React Router, **Redux**, Styled Components, D3, React DnD, FullCalendar
    + A **Node.js** back-end, built with **Express**, Passport, **MongoDB** (and **MySQL** in a separate branch)
- A public website built in 3 stages:
    + First with **HTML, Sass, vanilla JS** and the Google Maps SDK
    + Then moved to vanilla **PHP**
    + Then **Laravel**
- A **React Native** application for handling the self checkin process at the hotel.
